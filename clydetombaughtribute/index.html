            <h3 id="timelineH3" class=""><strong>Life and Times:</strong></h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1906</strong> - Born in Streator, Illinois to Muron Dealvo Tombaugh, a farmer, and his beloved wife
                Adella Pearl Chritton.</li>
              <li><strong>1922</strong> - Moved to Burdett, Kansas with plans to attend college that were foiled by a hailstorm
                that ruined his family's crops.</li>
              <li><strong>1926</strong> - Began to hand-build his own custom telescopes on his family's property. Tombaugh dug
                a 24 foot long, 8 foot wide and 7 foot deep pit for better testing of his telescopes. The ditch provided
                a constant air tempurature and freedom from air currents that could otherwise distort any images. He used
                this pit, as well as his telescopes, to produce several drawings of Jupiter and Mars, of which, he sent to
                the Lowell Observatory. As a curious side note, Tombaugh's family also used the ditch for a root cellar and
                emergency shelter.</li>
              <li><strong>1929</strong> - After sending drawings of Mars and Jupiter to Lowell Observatory, Tombaugh was offered
                a research job there. This is where he would eventually make his career-defining discovery. He would remain
                working there until 1945.</li>
              <li><strong>1930</strong> - Having been tasked with performing a systematic search for a trans-Neptunian object,
                known as Planet X to astronomers, Tombaugh would make the most important discovery of his career. The object
                was discovered, and a name was suggested by an 11-year-old schoolgirl. Pluto was officially discovered!</li>
              <li><strong>1931</strong> - Awarded the Jacksn-Gwilt Medal by The Royal Astronomical Society</li>
              <li><strong>1980</strong> - Co-Authored the book <em>Out of the Darkness: The Planet PLuto</em> with Patrick Moore.</li>
              <li><strong>1992</strong> - Gave his blessing, during a phonecall to JPL Scientist Robert Staehle, for NASA to
                send a mission to Pluto. "I told him he was welcome to it," Tombaugh later recalled, "though he's got to
                go one long, cold trip." This call planted the seeds for the 2006 <em>New Horizons</em> mission to Pluto.</li>
              <li><strong>1997</strong> - Died on January 17th, 1997, at the age of 90, in Las Cruces, New Mexico.</li>
              <li><strong>2006</strong> - A small portion of Tombaugh's ashes were placed aboard the <em>New Horizons</em> spacecraft.
                The container included an inscription: "Interred herein are the remains of American Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer
                of Pluto and the solar system's 'third zone'. Addele and Muron's boy, Patricia's husband, Annette and Alden's
                father, astronomer, teacher, punster, and friend: Clyde W. Tombaugh (1906-1997)"</li>
